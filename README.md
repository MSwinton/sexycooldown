# SexyCooldown

SexyCooldown (or "SCD") is a World of Warcraft addon. It allows you to display your buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns on a logarithmic bar. This lets you visualize a large number of items simultaneously, while easily seeing which will expire quickly.

Please note that while the addon should be functional as of WoW 8.0.3, I haven't played WoW for a while, and I make no guarantee as to the addon's functionality. Patches are welcome.
